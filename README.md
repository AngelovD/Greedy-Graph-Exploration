# Greedy-Graph-Exploration
A repository for the code and experiments related to the "Terrain exploration using a distributed graph-based multi-robot system"  and "Collaborative Terrain Exploration via a Distributed Graph Algorithm in Multi-Robot Systems" papers.

The main MAES simulator that is used to run the code and experiments can be found on https://github.com/DEIS-Tools/MAES?tab=readme-ov-file#running-in-unitymode.

Once MAES has been set up, add the files to the Scripts folder and run in Unity.
